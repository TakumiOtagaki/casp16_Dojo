# Overview
This Python script facilitates the extraction, merging, and optimization of RNA structures from PDB files using BioPython and Rosetta's rna_denovo tool. Specifically, it handles sequences derived from two different sources: AlphaFold3 and FARFAR2, optimizing the joint structure for further computational studies.

# Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
BioPython: Required for handling PDB files.
Rosetta Software Suite: Required for running rna_denovo for energy optimization.
Installation
Install BioPython:

コードをコピーする
```
pip install biopython
Install Rosetta:
```



Download Rosetta from the Rosetta website (registration and acceptance of user agreement required).
Follow the installation instructions provided on the site.
Script Files
rna_structure_integration.py: Main script that performs extraction, merging, and calls Rosetta.
Usage
Prepare Input Files:

Place your PDB files (alphafold3.pdb and farfar2.pdb) in the same directory as the script.
Edit Script Parameters:

Open rna_structure_integration.py.
Modify the parameters at the beginning of the script if different sequences or PDB files are used.
Run the Script:

bash
コードをコピーする
python rna_structure_integration.py
This will create a merged PDB file and run Rosetta optimization, outputting the results.

Important Notes
Ensure all file paths and names within the script match those on your system.
Rosetta commands within the script might need adjustments based on your specific installation and system configuration.
Troubleshooting
BioPython Errors: Ensure you are using the latest version of BioPython. Compatibility issues may arise with older versions.
Rosetta Errors: Check the Rosetta log files for specific error messages. Common issues often relate to improper file formats or command syntax.
